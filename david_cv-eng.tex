\parbox[t]{\textwidth}{\textbf{Double Degre M.S. Politecnico di
    Torino, EURECOM and Telecom ParisTech}}

Graduated in Computer Security and Computer Networking with strong
interest for distributed systems.

I carried out an experience in the Silicon Valley within a SDN
Startup. This context enriched my vision on new technologies and
allowed me to learn from brilliant people.

I am currently working for PLUMgrid.
